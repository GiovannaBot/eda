The Function T(n)
{: .fs-9}


What is?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300  }

T(n) is a function that represents the amount of a resource (usually time) needed to run an algorithm that processes an input of size n. Its purpose is to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm.

Why Determine T(n):
{: .fs-6 .fw-300  }

- Measure performance: Understand how the algorithmâ€™s resource consumption grows as the input size increases.
- Compare algorithms: Compare different algorithms to choose the most efficient one.
- Predict scalability: Estimate how well the algorithm performs with larger inputs.
- Optimize solutions: Identify and improve resource-intensive parts of the algorithm.

How Determine T(n):
{: .fs-6 .fw-300  }

Steps to Determine T(n):
- Identify the parameter that defines the problem size (n).
- Assign an abstract cost to each line of code.
- Determine how many times each line is executed.
- Calculate T(n) based on these executions.

Apply simplifications to make T(n) easier to interpret.
- Simplifications Used:
- Abstract costs for operations.
- Grouping of constants.
- Ignoring lower-order terms.

Ignoring the coefficient of the highest-order term.
In short, T(n) helps us analyze, compare, and optimize algorithms by understanding their resource consumption.
