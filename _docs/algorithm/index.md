Algorithms

What are data they?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300  }

Algorithm is a finite sequence of executable actions that aim to obtain the resolution of a task. An algorithm does not necessarily represent a computer program, but the steps needed to perform a task. It does not answer the question “what to do?”, but rather “how to do it“ [[1]](#ref1).

To perform a task, the algortithm must be unambiguous, standardized and precise. In other words a logical, finite and defined sequence of instructions that must be followed.

Algortithms can repeat steps or make decisions until the task is completed. Its implementation can be done by a computer, by another type of automaton or even by a human being.

Different algorithms can accomplish the same task using a different set of instructions in more or less time, space, or effort than others. This difference may be a reflection of the applied [computational complexity]({{site.baseurl}}/algorithm/computational_complexity), which depends on [data structures]({{site.baseurl}}/data_structure/) suitable for the algorithm.

Here we are going to talk about the main basics. I will explain it in detail and with a practical approach, where I will be implementing some [data structure]({{site.baseurl}}/data_structure/) and understanding the [computational complexity]({{site.baseurl}}/algorithm/computational_complexity), so that we can better understand how they work.
