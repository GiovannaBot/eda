Data Structure and algorithms

What are data structures?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300  }

An algorithm is basically a group of commands, step by step, to solve a specific problem. And data structures are different ways of storing and organizing data on the computer.

There are several data structures used in programming, here we are going to talk about four, lists, trees, graphs, Hash Tables and their variations which are widely used in application implementation [[1]](#ref1).

- Lists: Processes run on an operating system (queue); function calls in a code interpreter (stack);
- Trees: Search applications with constant data entry (Binary Trees);
- Graphs: Social networks; connection suggestion algorithms;
- Hash Tables: Databases; implementation of compilers.

It is essential to know these structures and understand how they work.

Algorithms and Data Structures are two closely related concepts. Data structures most often allow for better algorithms. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs. 

Which structure to choose? The answer depends on the application. Here we are going to talk about the main data structures. I'll explain it in detail and hands-on, implementing each one simply so we can understand how they work computationally.
